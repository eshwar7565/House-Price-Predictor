# ML_Project

This is a basic project of Machine Learning implementing the Linear Regression Algorithm.

In future I wil deploy on live server if possible.

It is tested on local server using nginx.


Model is trained with the help of builtin modules of python.

Sci-kit learn version 1.2.2

Scikit learn is built on Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib.

If any of used methods are deparcated or removed in future . Please visit documentation of Scikit learn.


Used Kaggle dataset to train the model.

Model has achieved 80.32% accuracy.

Mid multi level Project involving ML model, web frontend interface, backend.
